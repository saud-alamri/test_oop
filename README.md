PHP MySQL CRUD Application - Learning Resource
This repository contains a step-by-step example of building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using PHP and MySQL. It is designed as a hands-on learning resource for beginners and intermediate developers who want to understand the core principles of database interactions and server-side programming with PHP.

Features
Create: Add new records to the database using an intuitive form.
Read: Retrieve and display records in a user-friendly table format.
Update: Edit existing records with pre-filled forms for easy updates.
Delete: Remove records with confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletions.
What You'll Learn
Setting up a database and connecting it to PHP using MySQLi or PDO.
Writing SQL queries for CRUD operations.
Structuring PHP code for better readability and maintainability.
Creating dynamic HTML forms for interacting with the database.
Implementing basic error handling and validation.
Styling the application with minimal CSS for better UX (optional).
Bootstrap Integration
This project includes Bootstrap for styling, but it is not configured properly. Debugging the Bootstrap setup is left as an exercise for the developer. This is intended to help you practice troubleshooting and configuring external libraries within a project.
